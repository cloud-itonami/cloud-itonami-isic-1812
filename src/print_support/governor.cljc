  "PrintSupportGovernor — the independent safety/traceability layer for
  the ISIC-1812 independent print-support-services actor. Wired as its
  own `:govern` node in `print-support.actor`'s StateGraph, downstream of
  `:advise` — the Advisor has no notion of client provenance, equipment
  safety scope, or quality-verification risk, so this MUST be a separate
  system able to reject a proposal (itonami actor pattern, per
  ADR-2607011000 / CLAUDE.md Actors section).

  `check` is a pure function of (request, context, proposal, store) ->
  verdict; it never mutates the store. The StateGraph's `:decide` node
  routes on the verdict:
    :hard? true                → :hold  (irreversible, no write)
    :escalate? true            → :request-approval (interrupt-before)
    otherwise                  → :commit

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. client provenance  — the request's client must be registered.
    2. no-direct-actuation  — proposal :effect must be :propose
       (no direct equipment control or delivery release).

  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off):
    3. :op :flag-quality-defect — quality issues always escalate.
    4. :op :coordinate-delivery — final delivery release always escalates
       (high-risk job release).
    5. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`)."
