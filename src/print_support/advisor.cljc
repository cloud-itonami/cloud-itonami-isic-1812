(ns print-support.advisor
  "PrintSupportAdvisor — proposes a print-support operation (log a
  service job, schedule maintenance, flag a quality defect, coordinate
  delivery) for a registered print shop. The advisor is swappable:
  `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default in dev/tests/CI) or
  `llm-advisor` (wraps a real `langchain.model/ChatModel`). Either way
  the advisor ONLY produces a PROPOSAL — it never writes to the store
  and has no notion of client provenance, equipment safety scope, or
  quality-verification risk; `print-support.governor` is the independent
  system that decides whether the proposal may proceed, per the itonami
  actor pattern.

  A proposal is a map:
    {:op :log-service-job|:schedule-maintenance|:flag-quality-defect|:coordinate-delivery
     :effect :propose        ; the advisor NEVER emits a raw store write
     :stake :low|:medium|:high
     :confidence 0.0-1.0
     :rationale str}
  LLM parse failures always yield `:confidence 0.0` (never fabricate
  confidence), which forces the governor to escalate/hold."
